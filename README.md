# Custom 3-Set Venn Diagram in Python

This project provides a clean and customizable implementation of **3-set Venn diagrams** in Python using `matplotlib`. Unlike library-generated Venn diagrams, this version gives you **precise control over circle placement, size, and label positioning**. It's ideal for presenting complex set intersections in a visually clean, publication-ready format.

ðŸŽ¯ Features:
- Precise manual control of set overlap
- Label customization (bold, colors, etc.)
- Region-specific text rendering
- Exportable high-resolution images (e.g., PNG, PDF)
