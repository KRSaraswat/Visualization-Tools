## 🆚 How This Is Different from Standard Venn Libraries

Standard Python Venn libraries like `matplotlib-venn` generate diagrams with fixed logic and limited customization. This project, however, gives you:

- 📍 **Manual control** over circle positions and overlap
- 🔠 **Region-specific text** with smart label formatting
- 🧩 **Accurate visual reflection of set relationships**
- 🎨 Support for **bold labels**, color palettes, and readable layout
- 🖼️ **High-resolution exports** for reports and presentations

It's a great choice when you care about:
- How your Venn diagram looks
- Where each label appears
- Making sure diagrams **match your data** and not the other way around
- Render clean, label-friendly diagrams that are actually readable

This is ideal for:
📊 Research presentations
📄 Scientific publishing
🧪 Experimental set visualizations
📘 Teaching materials where clarity matters
